Ever wanted your own image board that is highly customizable?

Well now you can have one.

**Development in Progress**

# About #
Inspired by 4chan.org, I (EpicDewd) decided to create a new image board.  It will be coded in PHP and HTML5.  An updated browser with HTML5 support will be required (Safari, Firefox, Chrome).

## FAQ ##
Where do you get your code from.  It looks like you copy and paste...?

_Most of the HTML is **not** my work but **ALL** of the php is mine (Excluding some classes).  It either comes from some of my older projects and work._

Who are you?

_I'm EpicDewd.  Twitter.com/EpicDewd will give you enough info._

What inspired you do code this?

_I get bored.  Mostly everyone does.  So in my free time I code this._

How can I contact you?

_The best way to contact me would be my AIM (EpicDewd), then my Email (EpicDewd@Gmail.com) and last my Twitter (EpicDewd.)_
